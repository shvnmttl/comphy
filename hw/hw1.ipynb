    "# The Abelian sandpile\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to implement the celebrated [Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld model](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.59.381), also known as the \"Abelian sandpile.\" This cellular automaton describes a lattice in which sand grains are continuously dropped onto random locations at a fixed rate, resulting in the formation of random sandpiles. When the sandpiles grow too high, they topple, resulting in avalanches that distribute grains to all of their neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we denote the number of grains at a site $(x, y)$ as $z(x, y)$, a single \"topple\" event of the BTW model has the following update rule, which triggers only when $z \\geq 4$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "z(x, y) \\rightarrow z(x, y) - 4\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{array}{lr}\n",
    "    z(x + 1, y) \\leftarrow z(x + 1, y) + 1    \\\\\n",
    "    z(x - 1, y) \\leftarrow z(x - 1, y) + 1    \\\\\n",
    "    z(x, y + 1) \\leftarrow z(x, y + 1) + 1    \\\\\n",
    "    z(x, y - 1) \\leftarrow z(x, y - 1) + 1    \\\\\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A topple event thus consists of a single site decreasing in height by four grains, and then distributing these grains to each of its north, south, east, and west neighbors---but not its diagonal neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "After a single topple event, the entire lattice is checked again to see if any other sites now have $z \\geq 4$, in which case those sites are toppled, too. If a site located at the boundary of the domain topples, then any grains that would go out of bounds are assumed to be permanently lost from the system. After all sites reach a state where $z \\leq 4$, the avalanche has concluded. We then add a sand grain to a random new site, and calculate any new resulting avalanches.\n",
    "\n",
    "This idealized system has several interesting properties: the continuous addition of grains represents a slow-timescale driving process, which effectively injects energy into the system. The avalances represent fast-timescale response dynamics, and the grains that fall off the edges represent dissipation---they prevent avalanches from continuing forever undriven. Despite its seeming simplicity, the BTW model represents perhaps the earliest widely-studied toy model of \"self-organized criticality,\" a well-known hypothesis in nonequilibrium statistical physics that driven, dissipative systems tend to tune themselves into maximally-critical states (there are always sandpiles on the verge of toppling). The sandpile has been used as a thought experiment describing an incredible array of diverse systems, including: starts and stops in dragging friction, [earthquakes](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/JB094iB11p15635), timings between geyser eruptions, [timings of pulsar glitches](https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.6528), [fluctuations in an ultracold atomic gas](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1908-6), [neuronal activity patterns in the brain](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2014.00166/full), [flux pinning](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.67.919), and many other areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple signature of self-organized-criticality observed in the sandpile model, which also represents an easy readout for experimental data, is the appearance of $1/f$ noise in the system's power spectrum, where $f$ denotes frequency. This distribution implies that avalanche durations have a skewed distribution, where larger events happen less frequently. For an experimental system, this results in \"crackling\" or brown noise in the detector. In the BTW model, the authors note that a $1/f$ distribution of rare events in the frequency corresponds to a $1/T$ distribution of waiting times between rare events. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will implement the BTW model, and then test for the appearance of $1/f$ noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "## To Do:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implement the Abelian Sandpile model and simulate its dynamics. I've included a template for the solution below, although feel free to re-factor it if you would prefer to implement the problem in a different way. There are both an iterative and a recursive solutions to this problem.\n",
    "2. Using the code included below, show that avalanch durations exhibit a $1/T^\\alpha$ distribution, where $\\alpha$ is some constant.\n",
    "3. If a single image of the sandpile has size $N$ (the total number of lattice sites), what do you expect to be the worst-case scaling of the runtime of your algorithm? What about the expected scaling of memory usage?\n",
    "4. (Hard, optional) Try [vectorizing](https://realpython.com/numpy-array-programming/) your sandpile implementation, in order to reduce the number of \"for\" loops used in your implementation. How does vectorization affect the runtime?\n",
    "\n",
    "**If any student wants to try to implement the Kramer & Marder paper linked below instead of doing the BTW model, feel free to attempt it. I don't have a solution for it, but I would love to see one.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional information and follow-up\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Another member of our department, Michael Marder, has a [paper from 1992 in which he and his student Steve Kramer propose a cellular automaton model of river formation.](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.68.205) (Figure 2 is gorgeous!). The update rules and structure of implementing this simulation have many simularities to the BTW model, but, unlike the BTW model, there are not any open-source implementations of which I am aware.\n",
    "+ Among cellular automata, the BTW model is not only unique for its asynchronous nature, but also because it has a \"derivative\" ruleset in contrast to the \"integral\"/totalistic ruleset we see in better-known systems like the Game of Life: instead of updating a cell based on the sum of all its neighbors, we update all neighbors based on the state of a cell.\n",
    "+ The BTW model is called the \"Abelian\" sandpile because the final stable configuration is invariant to the order of toppling events. For example, instead of toppling the pile to completion after each addition, we could add $M$ several grains at once, and then perform a series of topples selecting unstable sites in any order until a stable configuration is achieved. The final sandpile would be identical to the one we would get if we simulated the pile through $M$ full additions sequentially.\n",

    "# Percolation\n",
    "\n",
    "The BTK cellular automaton represents a great example of a simple, toy computational model that exhibits non-trivial properties found in other, much more elaborate problems. It can be considered a [dynamical universality class](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.72.1690), meaning that many problems map onto it, independently of their microscopic details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will consider a well-known example of a universality class describing a nonequilibrium phase transition: the directed percolation problem. This problem is usually attributed to [Broadbent & Hammersley in 1957](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/mathematical-proceedings-of-the-cambridge-philosophical-society/article/percolation-processes/C00CC4943F48228F8AC8031092FE84EC).\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is deceptively simple: given a D-dimensional lattice (for our purposes, a 2D grid), we randomly mark sites as \"blocked\" or \"open\" with probability $p$. For a given value fo $p$, what is the probability that water poured into the top of the lattice will percolate to the bottom row through a chain of connected open sites? This problem is *directed percolation* because it has a preferred direction (water flows from top to bottom). We will assume two open sites are connected if one is north, south, east, or west of the other---but *not* diagonal. This corresponds to [von Neumann neighborhood rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_neighborhood).\n",
    "\n",
    "A percolation simulation should take a binary array, and return True if it percolates, and False if it does not. There are many ways to implement a percolat algorithm, most of which involve simulating the addition of water to the grid. One option would be start with the top row, mark all open sites as \"filled,\" and then pass to the next row and search for open sites connected to filled sites. Some addtional care is required, however, because water can pass through channels within a row until it reaches sites that are not directly below filled sites. One workaround would be to perform multiple iterative passes until the filled lattice stops changing. Another simulation option would be a depth-first-search, where we start from each site on the top row and we search for any chain of N/S/E/W hops that leads to the other side of the lattice. This last methods demonstrates the conceptual simularity between directed percolation and solving a maze puzzle; the only difference that the \"blocked\" sites in a maze are non-random.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we are going to implemented a directed percolation model, and then perform experiments with it in order to determine how the percolation probability depends on the fraction of open sites $p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## To Do\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implement a two dimensional directed percolation model in Python. I've included my code outline below.\n",
    "    + The naive solution simulates water pouring into the top row, and then iterate over rows and sites\n",
    "    + Can you think of a faster way of solving this problem? (Hint: we may not have seen recursion in class yet, but it may be helpful). If you want to try implementing your solution, you will need to add an additional private method `_flow_recursive(i, j)` that contains the recursive logic\n",
    "2. Perform replicate simulations using the code I've provided below, and create a plot showing how the probability of percolation changes as a function of $p$ (the blockage probability). Beyond seeing the predictable percolation to clogging transition, you'll notice that the variance in the outcome of your simulations behaves unexpectedly. What is going on here? (Hint: If you've studied the Ising model, you've seen something like this before)\n",
    "3. Theoretically, does the transition point seen in our empirical results align with your intuition? Why does its value differ from $p=0.5$? (Hint: think about sites versus connections between sites).\n",
    "4. How does the memory usage and runtime of your percolation model implement scale with the lattice size? You can answer this empirically or theoretically.\n",
    "5. One way to sweep the control parameter $p$ would be to start in a limit where most of the sites are blocked, and then gradually open up individual sites one at a time until the lattice percolates. A video of a simulation where the lattice is gradually opened can be seen [here](https://vimeo.com/747772333). How do the different events in the gradually unblocked percolation simulation relate to the two timescales we saw in the sandpile problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Follow-up and more information\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Directed percolation maps onto all sorts of interesting problems in physics and graph theory. There are literal applications of percolation to [flow in porous media](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0305-4470/14/5/012/meta), as well as [electrical conductance](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.26.5293) and [light propagation in disordered materials](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.99.234503). A great example of universality is [recent work](https://www.nature.com/articles/nphys3548) showing similar scaling exponents describe both ecological collapse and pipe turbulence, which both map onto the DP universality class. [Here's another recent paper](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007508) that uses percolation theory to understand electrical signalling between neighboring cells in a biofilm. \n",
